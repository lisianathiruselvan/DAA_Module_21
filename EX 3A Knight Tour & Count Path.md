# EX 3A Knight Tour & Count Path
## DATE: 18.3.25
## AIM:
To write a python program to find minimum steps to reach to specific cell in minimum moves by knight


## Algorithm
1. Initialize movement options for the knight (8 possible moves) and a queue for BFS traversal.

2. Start BFS from the knightâ€™s initial position and mark it as visited.

3. Iterate using BFS, exploring all valid and unvisited knight moves from the current cell.

4. Check if the target is reached at each step; if so, return the number of moves (distance).

5. Continue BFS until the target is found or the queue is empty, returning infinity if unreachable.

## Program:

            y = curr.y + dy[i]

            if isInside(x, y, N) and not visited[x][y]:
                visited[x][y] = True
                queue.append(cell(x, y, curr.dist + 1))

    return float('inf')

    targetpos = [30, 30]
    print(minStepToReachTarget(knightpos,

## Result:
The program executed successfully, and the minimum number of steps for the knight to reach the target was calculated.
